
Here are some ideas for how to section your notes based on the information you provided about TensorFlow, hyperparameters, and neural network layers:

### Main Sections:

1. TensorFlow Basics:
    * Introduction to TensorFlow
    * Installing and Importing TensorFlow
    * Constants and Variables
    * Simple Operations and Tensors
    * Placeholders and Data Feeding
2. Neural Network Fundamentals:
    * Building a Linear Regression Model
    * Loss Functions and Optimization
    * Activation Functions
    * Training Loop and Metrics
3. Hyperparameter Tuning:
    * Importance of Hyperparameters
    * Common Hyperparameters (batch size, epoch, learning rate)
    * GridSearchCV and RandomSearch for Exploration
    * Visualizing Tuning Results
4. Deep Learning Layers:
    * Dense Layers: Parameters and Activation Functions
    * Dropout Layers for Regularization
    * Additional Layer Types (convolutional, recurrent, pooling)
    * Compile Parameters and Training Configuration
5. Additional Notes:
    * Code snippets and resources for further learning
    * Specific questions or challenges you encountered

### Sub-Sections (optional):
    * Within each main section, you can create sub-sections for specific topics or examples.
    * Consider adding headers, bullet points, and diagrams for better organization and clarity.
    * Use different colors or fonts to highlight important information.



### Neural Network Fundamentals:
import tensorflow as tf

# Assuming you have your data in NumPy arrays
x_train = np.array(...)
y_train = np.array(...)

model = tf.keras.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(1)  # Single neuron for linear regression
])

model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mean_squared_error')

model.fit(x_train, y_train, epochs=100)  # Adjust epochs as needed
