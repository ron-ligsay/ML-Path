# Creating Neural Network Layers and Models
# A neural network model is a collection of layers.

# A layer is a defined set of computations which takes a given tensor as input and produces another tensor as output.

# For example, a simple layer could just add 1 to all the elements of an input tensor.

# The important point is that a layer manipulates (performs a mathematical operation on) an input tensor in some way to produce an output tensor.

# Combine a series of layers together and you have a model.

# The term “deep learning” comes from the stacking of large numbers of layers on top of eachother (deep in this sense is a synonym for large).

# The best way to stack layers together to find patterns in data is constantly changing.

# This is why techniques such as *transfer learning* are helpful because they allow you to leverage what has worked for someone else’s similar problem and tailor it to your own.
