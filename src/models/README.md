## Models


### LSTM
LSTM is a type of RNN that is able to remember information for long periods of time. It is able to do this because it has three gates: input gate, forget gate and output gate. The input gate decides which values from the input to update the cell state. The forget gate decides which values from the cell state to throw away. The output gate decides which values from the cell state to output.


### SVM
SVMS are a type of supervised learning algorithm that can be used for both classification and regression. They are able to find a hyperplane that separates the data into classes. The hyperplane is found by maximizing the margin between the hyperplane and the closest data points. The hyperplane is found by minimizing the following equation:
