
### Overfitting
* performs great on training data
* performs poorly on testing data
* model memorized training dataand can't generalize learnings to new data
* use testing set to check mmodel performance

### Underfitting
* performs poorly on training data
* performs poorly on testing data
* model didn't learn training data and can't generalize learnings to new data
* use testing set to check mmodel performance
