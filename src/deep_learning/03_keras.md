### When to use neural networks?
* dealing with unstructured data
* don't need e asily interpretable results
* you can benefit from a known architecture
Example: classify images of cats and dogs
* **images -> unstructured data**
* you don't care about why the network knows it's a cat or a dog
* you can benefit from cnn

### Coding keras
using functional or sequential API


## Surviving Meteor Strike
**compiling**
```model.compile()```

**training**
```model.fil(x,y,epochs=100)```

**predicting**
```preds = model.predict()```

**evaluating**
```model.evaluate(x,y)```
