### When to use neural networks?
* dealing with unstructured data
* don't need e asily interpretable results
* you can benefit from a known architecture
Example: classify images of cats and dogs
* **images -> unstructured data**
* you don't care about why the network knows it's a cat or a dog
* you can benefit from cnn
